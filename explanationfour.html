    <h2>Accessible CSS Layout</h2>
    <p>
        In this lab assignment, the focus was on creating a multicolumn webpage with a structured layout, including a header, navigation bar, main content area, two asides, and a footer. The design of the layout was achieved using CSS, with the utilization of CSS grid areas and CSS flexbox. This allowed for both a 2D layout, structuring different sections of the webpage, and a 1D navigation unordered list of links, providing flexibility in organizing the navigation. 
        I chose to create webpage that resembles a coffee shop, the objective was to design a multicolumn webpage for a coffee shop using HTML and CSS. The webpage included a header, navigation bar, main content area with two sections, and a footer, all styled using CSS. CSS grid areas and flexbox were employed to achieve a 2D layout and a 1D navigation unordered list of links, respectively.

        The content of the webpage was tailored for a coffee shop. The navigation bar contained links relevant to the coffee shop's pages such as Home, Menu, About Us, and Contact Us. The main content section was divided into two parts: the first section welcomed visitors to the coffee shop and the second section displayed the menu, including various types of coffee and special offerings for the day.
        
        To ensure accessibility and validate adherence to web standards, I used tools like WAVE, W3C validator, and HTML5 outliner. These tools helped verify that the webpage was accessible and complied with the recommended coding practices.

        I found the implementation interesting, particularly appreciating how a multicolumn layout ensures that content is well-displayed across various screen sizes. This approach not only provides a good structure to the webpage but also enhances its visual appeal.
