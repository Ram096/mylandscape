          <h2>Why Universal Design?</h2>
          <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ppMvTJNlvI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <p>Universal design is embraced to create products, environments, and systems that are accessible and usable by people of all abilities, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. The primary motivations for universal design stem from a commitment to inclusivity, equality, and social responsibility. By adopting universal design principles, several key benefits are realized:</p>
            <ul class = "benefits">
              <li>Inclusivity: Can participate fully in various aspects of life. It promotes an inclusive society where no one is excluded based on their physical or cognitive characteristics.</li>

              <li>Equity and Equality: Universal design contributes to a more equitable and fair society by providing equal opportunities for participation and access to information, services, and the built environment. It helps bridge the gap between individuals with different abilities.</li>
              
              <li>Diverse User Base: In recognizing and accommodating diverse needs, universal design caters to a wide range of users. This not only includes people with disabilities but also individuals with temporary impairments, the elderly, and those with different cultural backgrounds.</li>
              
              <li>Legal Compliance: Many countries and regions have enacted accessibility laws and standards that mandate the incorporation of universal design principles in public spaces, digital platforms, and services. Adhering to these regulations ensures legal compliance.</li>
              
              <li>Enhanced User Experience: Universal design often leads to improved usability and a better overall user experience. Designing with inclusivity in mind results in products and environments that are more user-friendly and accommodating to a broader audience.</li>
              
              <li>Cost-Efficiency: While there might be initial costs associated with implementing universal design, in the long run, it can be more cost-effective. Creating products and spaces that require fewer adaptations or retrofits reduces the need for constant modifications to accommodate diverse users.</li>
              
              <li>Future-Proofing: Universal design anticipates and prepares for future demographic changes and advancements in technology. As populations age and technology evolves, the principles of universal design ensure that products and environments remain relevant and accessible.</li>
              
              <li>Social Responsibility: Embracing universal design reflects a commitment to social responsibility. It acknowledges the importance of fostering an inclusive and compassionate society that values the well-being and dignity of all its members.</li>
            </ul>
           <br>
           <br>   
          <h2>What are some examples of Universal Design?</h2>
          <br>
          <ul class = "examples">
            <li>Zero step entrances to buildings  </li>
            <li>Handles instead of knobs</li>
            <li>Covered bus shelters with on-demand heating</li>
            <li>Crossing signals that can be both heard and seen</li>
            <li>Curb cuts, ramps, and wide sidewalks for wheelchairs and strollers</li>
            <li>Benches in public places that offer a place to rest</li>
            <li>Directional signs and/or maps with large text to help with wayfinding Protected bike lanes for safety</li>

        <h2>Statistics</h2>
        <ul class = "statistics">
          <li><a>As populations age, the need for universal design becomes more critical. According to the World Health Organization, the global population aged 60 years and older is expected to double by 2050.</a>
          </li>
          <li><a>According to the World Bank, around 15% of the world's population (over a billion people) live with some form of disability.</a>
        </li>
        <li><a>The World Institute on Disability estimates that the annual disposable income of households with a person with a disability is around $8 trillion globally. Designing products and services with accessibility in mind can tap into this market.</a>
        </li>
        <li><a>The Job Accommodation Network (JAN) reports that accommodations for employees with disabilities are often low-cost or free, with the majority of accommodations costing less than $500.</a>
