    <h2>Coding & Posting a Web Page - The Basics</h2>
    <p>
        In this lab assignment, the task was to create an accessible website using various techniques learned in class. These techniques included using HTML5 semantic structure, adding anchor links to different sections for easy navigation, creating an auto-centering wrapper for the content, visually hiding elements while still making them accessible for screen readers (sr-only), and choosing an appropriate color scheme.

        Students were given the flexibility to choose any topic for their website and design it according to their preferences, as long as they adhered to the accessibility principles taught in class. The implementation also involved checking the accessibility of the website using tools such as WAVE, W3C validator, and HTML5 outliner to ensure it met the required standards.
        
        I specifically enjoyed learning about making content accessible for screen readers using the sr-only technique. This technique involves hiding elements visually while still allowing them to be read by screen readers, thus improving the overall accessibility of the website.
