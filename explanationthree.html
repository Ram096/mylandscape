    <h2>Tables, Forms, Tabbed Browsing, and Screen Reading</h2>
    <p>
        In this lab assignment, the goal was to design a webpage incorporating various accessibility features, including an accessible form, an accessible table, Google icons, and skip navigation. The student chose to create a page dedicated to their favorite soccer (football) club, Atl√©tico de Madrid. The webpage comprised an informative "About" section detailing the club, an accessible table listing players with the most games for the club, and an accessible form for user interaction.

        The accessibility of the webpage was further ensured by conducting checks using tools like WAVE, W3C validator, and HTML5 outliner. These tools help ensure that the webpage adheres to accessibility standards, making it usable for a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities.
        
        The student found the topics of accessible tables and forms particularly interesting. Understanding the importance of making tables and forms accessible is crucial, as these elements often contain vital information. Ensuring accessibility in these components contributes to a better user experience for individuals who may face challenges in comprehending or interacting with complex data.
        
        Moreover, the implementation of skip navigation for me is an interesting aspect of the learning process. Skip navigation is a feature that allows users, especially those navigating through keyboard inputs, to skip directly to the main content of the page, improving the efficiency of their interaction.
